```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(listviewer)
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", 
                      message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,
                      error = FALSE, eval = TRUE)
```

Over the past few months, I worked on several projects that involved accessing web API's in R, which meant I spent a lot of time puzzling over the functions and code in the [httr package](https://github.com/r-lib/httr). I came to really enjoy referring back to the [`content()`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr/blob/1fc659856602f60ff75eb01903513244e3491ec2/R/content.r) function in particular--it seemed that I learned something new every time I went back to it!

## httr basics

You can use httr's `GET` function to read any URL into your R session. However, some URL's are more conducive to parsing and manipulation than others. For example, I can use `GET` to retrieve a csv file.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(httr)
internet_thing <- GET("https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/urn:uuid:9e123f84-ce0d-4094-b898-c9e73680eafa")
```

If you take a look at the `internet_thing`, it looks something like this: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(httr) # load this for real
internet_thing <- readRDS("httr-req.RDS") # to avoid GETing each time I knit
xx <- unlist(list(internet_thing), recursive = FALSE) #change to list class
xx$handle <- NULL #remove bc of external pointer
jsonedit(xx)
```

The `internet_thing` includes a `url`, `status_code`, and a number of other attributes. The `content` looks particularly scary because it's still in a raw format. 

When we bring the `content()` function into the game, voila -- the `internet_thing` gets automatically parsed into a tibble. 

```{r}
data <- content(internet_thing)
data[, 1:5] # showing just the first 5 columns
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/10UeedrT5MIfPG/giphy.gif")
```

#### How did `content()` understand that the gobbledygook was a csv?

If you look back at the `internet_thing`, you can see that `text/csv` specified as the `content-type` in the `header` section. The `content()` function "sees" this specification and tries to parse it in an appropriate manner.  In this case, it means reading the content of the `internet_thing` in using `read_csv()`. (If you're _really_ curious about the specifics, more details are in [the code](https://github.com/r-lib/httr/blob/1fc659856602f60ff75eb01903513244e3491ec2/R/content-parse.r#L66)!)

_Also: for more info on API's, the httr [quickstart guide](http://httr.r-lib.org/articles/quickstart.html) and [vignettes](http://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html) are solid places to start. The first half of the [RStudio Plumber webinar](https://rstd.io/plumber-webinar) is also a great intro!_  

This post is dedicated to the small but neat things I learned as I was trying to figure out the logic behind the function, so...

## On with the **tricks**!

### Embrace the backtick

When I came across the following piece of code, I wasn't entirely sure what the `%||%` operator did, so I tried the normal approach: [googling it](https://www.google.com/search?q=%25%7C%7C%25&oq=%25%7C%7C%25&aqs=chrome..69i57.3928j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 

```{r eval = FALSE}
type <- type %||% x$headers[["Content-Type"]] %||%
    mime::guess_type(x$url, empty = "application/octet-stream")
```

This time, Google totally failed me, so I tried  searching for it on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-lib/httr/search?q=%25%7C%7C%25&unscoped_q=%25%7C%7C%25). And failed. Again.  I knew it must be there, but I simply could _not_ figure out how to search it! 

Thankfully, Twitter was there for me in my time of need:

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '997178960797687809')
```

In retrospect, the backticks are obvious, but I couldn't quite put my finger on the problem at the time. In fact, I still haven't figured out how to Google for it directly (so send me a message if you do!).  

If you want some more **backtick action**, try this in your R console: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
?`'`
```

### The null-default operator `%||%`

Also known as the [null coalescing operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator), this operator allows you to run through a series of values and take the first one that is _not_ NULL. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '997183697781587968')
```

I later discovered that this operator is exported not only by `rlang` but also `purrr`, and is used throughout the `tidyverse` set of packages.

That inspired me to write my own version of this function, my very own *null-na-default operator*, which returns the first argument that is neither `NA` nor `NULL`. I've only found one clunky [use-case](https://github.com/NCEAS/metajam/blob/51b7e54c4ac923a98685d4854191a8d92dc2891c/R/download_d1_data.R#L140) for it so far, but I'm keeping my eyes out for other opportunities.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
`%|||%` <- function (x, y) {
  if (is.null(x) | is.na(x)) {
    y
  }
  else {
    x
  }
}
```

### Check argument inputs with `match.arg()`

I am slow to develop this particular habit, but in general, it's always a good idea to check a user's arguments at the beginning of a function. That way, you can break out of the function early and avoid confusing error messages that get you chasing bugs in the wrong direction.  

```{r error = TRUE}
arg <- "howdy"
match.arg(arg, c("howdy", "aloha", "g'day"))

arg <- "howday"
match.arg(arg, c("howdy", "aloha", "g'day"))
```

It also assumes you want partial-matching but throws an error if multiple options match.

```{r error = TRUE}
arg <- "how"
match.arg(arg, c("howdy", "aloha", "g'day"))

arg <- "how"
match.arg(arg, c("howdy", "aloha", "g'day", "how are ya?"))
```

### `switch()` out your if-elses

You can't always escape if-else chains, but sometimes you can use `switch()` to evaluate different expressions depending on your input. Take this example:

```{r message = FALSE}
emph <- "smile"

if(emph == "regular") {
    print("how's it going?")
} else if (emph == "smile") {
    print("how's it going? :)")
} else if (emph == "exclamation") {
    print("how's it going?!")
}
```

versus

```{r}
switch(emph,
       regular = print("how's it going?"),
       smile = print("how's it going? :)"),
       exclamation = print("how goes?!"))
```

The changes I've made here were pretty tame, but really, anything is possible (though you probably don't want to surprise your users too much).

```{r}
switch(emph,
       regular = paste("Which would you choose?", pi, "or pie?"),
       smile = 1:3,
       exclamation = factorial(10))
```

As [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan) put it in her excellent [Code Smells and Feels](https://rstd.io/code-smells) talk at the 2018 useR conference:

> `switch()` is ideal if you need to dispatch different **logic**, based on a **string**.  
> You are allowed to write a helper function to generate that string.

The tidyverse friend of the `switch` is [`case_when`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html). In Jenny's words: 

> `dplyr::case_when()` is ideal if you need to dispatch different **data**, based on **data (+ logic)**.

_Note: the talk also covers our friend the null-coalescing operator `%||%`!_

### Strange bedfellows

I thought I was relatively comfortable with lists until I saw _functions_ stored in a list.  Check it out for yourself in the code of the [`parse_auto()`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr/blob/1fc659856602f60ff75eb01903513244e3491ec2/R/content-parse.r#L66) helper function, which is called by `content()`.  It still blows my mind a little, but I realize now that it's a form of [object-oriented programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html).

Depending on what type of `internet_thing` we give it, `parse_auto()` will find the function best suited to it. For example, the following snippet (which I've shortened from the original) shows that different functions--the aptly named `read_xml()` and `read_csv`--are called to depending on whether the metadata of the `internet_thing` says it's an XML file or a csv.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
parsers$`text/xml` <- function(x, type = NULL, ...) {
  need_package("xml2")
  xml2::read_xml(x, encoding = encoding, ...)
}

parsers$`text/csv` <- function(x, type = NULL, ...) {
  need_package("readr")
  readr::read_csv(x, locale = readr::locale(encoding = encoding), ...)
}
```

## tl;dr - _do_ read the source code!

Admittedly, not all source code is created equal, but try to at least skim through!  If you find that you can read through the code almost like it's English, then you've probably found a human-readable gem.
