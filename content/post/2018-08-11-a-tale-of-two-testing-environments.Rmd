Today marks the second time I've debugged the problem of tests that **pass** with `devtools::test()` but **fail** with `devtools::check()`. Since I'm now riding my debug-success high (and hope never to repeat this again), here is a blogpost.

![](https://github.com/isteves/website/blob/master/static/taleoftwocities.jpg?raw=true)

### Background

There are _some_ resources online ([see below](#internet-solutions)) to help with debugging this particular problem, but they are sparse and situation-specific.  In the [Automated Checking](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html) chapter of [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), Hadley writes:

>Occasionally you may have a problem where the tests pass when run interactively with `devtools::test()`, but fail when in `R CMD check`. This usually indicates that you’ve made a faulty assumption about the testing environment, and it’s often hard to figure it out.

This is _so true_, but also not really what I wanted to read when I was stuck in this situation.

### Lesson 1: check suggested packages

My first experience with the two-testing-environment problem involved the [`httr`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr) package, which I wrote about in my [previous blogpost](https://irene.rbind.io/post/fun-prog-httr/).  In this package, the `content()` function takes an API response and by default, tries to parse the response.  I happily used this to automatically read in a csv--that is, until I realized that it was the source of my debugstration.

Turns out, the `content()` function calls `readr::read_csv()` by default. Since `readr` is listed in [`Suggests`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr/blob/976289a3596dc01dc994f8fd743770a172bbecdb/DESCRIPTION#L19) in the `httr` package, it was not accounted for in R CMD CHECK. Once I added it to the DESCRIPTION file of my own package, all tests were happy once again.

### Lesson 2: MODULARIZE + use vagrant scripts with _extreme_ caution

This time around, I knew right away that it had something to do with my environment, but I still needed hours to figure it out (granted, I ran into this bug late on a Friday so perhaps the other lesson here is...try again Monday). This time, I was in the unfortunate position of a test breaking on a "workhorse" function which--in retrospect--was trying to do way too much:

- it sourced functions and ran them (there is a complicated reason for this and yes, this is where it all broke down)
- it copied files from one place to another (and renamed them in the process)
- it created a file based off of a template function
- it read a YAML file

The YAML part was actually the easiest, since it was already its own function.  I wrote some tests and confirmed that this was not the breaking piece. 

The other parts were a bit harder to figure out because they were not modularized. Starting out with functional programming, it's easy to get stuck on the "three times" rule:

>You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code).  ([R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#when-should-you-write-a-function))

or in Twitter form:

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '909242896691466240')
```

However,  _even_ if they are only used once, functions are also important to keep code _modular_ and _readable_. **Modularity** is particularly useful for testing and debugging. **Readability** can be enhanced by using small, well-named helpers rather than comments.  Check out [Code Smells and Feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY?start=1294) for an example:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oyiPBjLAWY?start=1294" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Finally, I dug into my ill-fated sourcery. Because these extra functions were not an official part of the package (they live in `inst`), there was no automatic check on them to catch packages not listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file. Thus, they were only tested when called explicitly, and broke in weird ways.

Coincidentally, the culprit happened to be `readr` again. Once I put it into my `DESCRIPTION`, I was on the home stretch.

In retrospect, the error message about failing namespaces makes a _bit_ more sense:

```
checking tests ... ERROR
  Running 'testthat.R'
Running the tests in 'tests/testthat.R' failed.
Last 13 lines of output:
  5: getExportedValue(pkg, name)
  6: asNamespace(ns)
  7: getNamespace(ns)
  8: tryCatch(loadNamespace(name), error = function(e) stop(e))
  9: tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
  10: tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
  11: value[[3L]](cond)
```

### Internet solutions

In my meanderings through GitHub issues and StackOverflow, I came across some other solutions to this problem:

- In [this](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/86) GitHub issue,  [lhsego](https://github.com/lhsego) writes: "Simply add `Sys.setenv("R_TESTS" = "")` as the first line in tests/testthat.R"  
- In the same issue, [espinielli](https://github.com/espinielli) writes: "In my particular case, the discrepancy I got between `devtools::test()` and `devtools::check()` was due to having the definition of a new unit in a .R file rather than inside `.onLoad()` (and removing it in `.onUnload()`)."
- On StackOverflow, [wligtenberg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42272119/r-cmd-check-fails-devtoolstest-works-fine) ended up self-solving: 
"In the end, the issue was trivial. I used base::sort() to create the levels of a factor. (To ensure that they would always align, even if the data was in a different order.)  The problem is, that the default sort method depends on the locale of your system. And R CMD check uses a different locale than my interactive session."

### Conclusion

Debugging this kind of error is no joke! In the future, I would start with the following:

- check the DESCRIPTION file -- does it really list _all_ the packages I'm using?
- check the `Suggests` section in other packages -- make sure you list any relevant packages somewhere, too
- use `Sys.getenv()` to make sure you're not making any environmental assumptions that interfere with testing

Finally, [be strategic](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html#debugging-techniques): _isolate_ the problem, test it _systematically_, and _learn_ from the pain of those who debugged before you.
