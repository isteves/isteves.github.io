Aside from the workshops and talks at [#rstudioconf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstudioconf?src=hash) back in January, I picked up many useful nuggets from the stream of conference tweets. I was particularly struck by this one:

```{r echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1086253815916126209')
```

Not feeling the amazement? Okay, let me explain...

Loyal readers may remember my [previous blogpost](https://irene.rbind.io/post/iterative-testing-plumber/), in which I described starting a new R process to run a plumber API for testing. To do so, I  opened up a new RStudio terminal with `rstudioapi::terminalCreate()`, then sent it commands with `terminalSend()`. My commands sometimes "got lost" if I sent them too soon, so I forced my function to "nap" and try again until the commands were fully complete. A bit of a convoluted workaround, but it worked.

The `callr` package, on the other hand, deals with R processes in a much more sophisticated way. The authors describe it this way:

> Call R from R: It is sometimes useful to perform a computation in a separate R process, without affecting the current R process. This package does exactly that.

## The goods

I was able to catch Gábor Csárdi, the creator and maintainer of the `callr` package, at the [#TidyverseDevDay](https://github.com/tidyverse/dev-day-2019) for a live demo. 

Gábor showed me `r()`, which evaluates an expression in another R session, and then returns the output. The first argument is a function, and the second argument is a list of the arguments/parameters to pass into the function.

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(callr)
r(function(i) 1 + i, list(i = 5))
```

Try running the code again and observe how it freezes up your R session for a moment before returning the answer `6`. It sends the call, then waits for the response and returns it to you.

The `r_bg()` (background) function takes the same arguments, but once it sends your expression to the new R session, it stops immediately. You must retrieve the output yourself by using `$get_result()` on the R process object.

```{r}
my_r_process <- r_bg(function(i) 1 + i, list(i = 5))
my_r_process$wait()
my_r_process$get_result()
```

If you try to `get_result()` right away, you get an error (though you may not notice if you run these lines interactively one-by-one).

```{r error = TRUE}
my_r_process <- r_bg(function(i) 1 + i, list(i = 5))
my_r_process$get_result()
```

Because of this behavior, `r_bg()` is much faster than `r()`. However, if you try to retrieve the output to soon, you may run into errors.

```{r}
library(tictoc)
tic(); r(function(i) 1 + i, list(i = 5)); toc()
tic(); r_bg(function(i) 1 + i, list(i = 5)); toc()
```

For code that takes a while to run, the ["notorious"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biIRlcQqmOc) `r_bg()` is a clear winner--it keeps your console free to use while working hard on your behalf in the background.

## Mixing it up with R6

You can browse through the available functions if you type `callr::` (hit `<TAB>` if nothing shows up automatically). You may notice that some of the options are not functions at all, but rather _R6 class generators_.

```{r}
class(callr::r_process)
```

What in the world is R6?[^1] Unlike regular R objects, R6 objects are _mutable_. That is, you can change them without having to reassign the changed version to the old variable name. This sort of functionality is particularly well-suited to _processes_.

[^1]: For a full explanation of R6, take a look at [this chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html) in Advanced R.

In pseudo-code, it goes something like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# "normal" R - variables don't change unless they are reassigned
my_num <- 7
my_num <- multiply_three(my_num)
my_num # becomes 21 because it has been re-assigned
```

versus

```{r eval = FALSE}
# the world of R6
my_num <- MyR6Class$new(7)
my_num$multiply_three() 
my_num # magically becomes 21
```

Those of you familiar with Python or other programming languages may already have some intuition for mutable objects.

## Process versus session

Among the R6 classes in the package are `r_process` and `r_session`. An `r_process` starts in the background, evaluates an R function call, and then _quits_. 

```{r}
rp <- r_process$new(r_process_options(func = function(i) i + 1,
                                      args = list(i = 2)))
rp$wait() # if we call get_result too soon, we get an error
rp$get_result()
rp
```

On the other hand, an `r_session` continues to run in the background until it is explicitly closed.

```{r}
rs <- r_session$new()
rs$run(function(i) i + 1, args = list(i = 2))
rs$run(function() paste(stringr::fruit[1:3], collapse = " and "))
rs
```

## Conclusion

R is a single-threaded language, meaning that it can only handle one thing at a time. We have ways of speeding things up with vectorization and parallelization, but `callr` provides us with even more flexibility. We can partition code into separate processes ourselves. Next time, instead of `source()`ing your script or--as in my previous case--opening up a new RStudio terminal, consider if it's time to call up an R process.
