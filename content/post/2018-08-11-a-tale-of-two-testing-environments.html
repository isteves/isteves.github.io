<p>Today marks the second time I’ve debugged the problem of tests that <strong>pass</strong> with <code>devtools::test()</code> but <strong>fail</strong> with <code>devtools::check()</code>. Since I’m now riding my debug-success high (and hope never to repeat this again), here is a blogpost.</p>

<div id="background" class="section level3">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>There are <em>some</em> resources online (<a href="#internet-solutions">see below</a>) to help with debugging this particular problem, but they are sparse and situation-specific. In the <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html">Automated Checking</a> chapter of <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">R packages</a>, Hadley writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally you may have a problem where the tests pass when run interactively with <code>devtools::test()</code>, but fail when in <code>R CMD check</code>. This usually indicates that you’ve made a faulty assumption about the testing environment, and it’s often hard to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>so true</em>, but also not really what I wanted to read when I was stuck in this situation.</p>

<div id="lesson-1-check-suggested-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Lesson 1: check suggested packages</h3>
<p>My first experience with the two-testing-environment problem involved the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/httr"><code>httr</code></a> package, which I wrote about in my <a href="https://irene.rbind.io/post/fun-prog-httr/">previous blogpost</a>. In this package, the <code>content()</code> function takes an API response and by default, tries to parse the response. I happily used this to automatically read in a csv–that is, until I realized that it was the source of my debugging frustration.</p>
<p>Turns out, the <code>content()</code> function calls <code>readr::read_csv()</code> by default. Since <code>readr</code> is listed in <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/httr/blob/976289a3596dc01dc994f8fd743770a172bbecdb/DESCRIPTION#L19"><code>Suggests</code></a> in the <code>httr</code> package, it was not accounted for in R CMD CHECK. Once I added it to the DESCRIPTION file of my own package, all tests were happy once again.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: MODULARIZE + use vagrant scripts with caution</h3>
<p>This time around, I knew right away that the problem had something to do with my environment, but I still needed hours to figure it out (granted, I ran into this bug late on a Friday so perhaps the other lesson here is…try again Monday). This time, I was in the unfortunate position of a test breaking on a “workhorse” function which–in retrospect–was trying to do way too much:</p>
<ul>
<li>it sourced functions and ran them (there is a complicated reason for this and yes, this is where it all broke down)</li>
<li>it copied files from one place to another (and renamed them in the process)</li>
<li>it created a file based off of a template function</li>
<li>it read a YAML file</li>
</ul>
<p>The YAML part was actually the easiest, since it was already its own function. I wrote some tests and confirmed that this was not the breaking piece.</p>
<p>The other parts were a bit harder to figure out because they were not modularized. Starting out with functional programming, it’s easy to get stuck on the “three times” rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code). (<a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#when-should-you-write-a-function">R4DS</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or in Twitter form:</p>

<p>However, even if they are only used <em>once</em>, functions help keep code <em>modular</em> and <em>readable</em>. <strong>Modularity</strong> is particularly useful for testing and debugging. <strong>Readability</strong> can be enhanced by using small, well-named helpers rather than comments. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY?start=1294">Code Smells and Feels</a> for an example:</p>

</iframe>
<p>Finally, I dug into my ill-fated sourcery. Because these extra functions were not an official part of the package (they live in <code>inst</code>), there was no automatic check on them to catch packages not listed in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file. Thus, they were only tested when called explicitly, and broke in weird ways.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the culprit happened to be <code>readr</code> again. Once I put it into my <code>DESCRIPTION</code>, I was on the home stretch.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the error message about failing namespaces makes a <em>bit</em> more sense:</p>
<pre><code>checking tests ... ERROR
  Running &#39;testthat.R&#39;
Running the tests in &#39;tests/testthat.R&#39; failed.
Last 13 lines of output:
  5: getExportedValue(pkg, name)
  6: asNamespace(ns)
  7: getNamespace(ns)
  8: tryCatch(loadNamespace(name), error = function(e) stop(e))
  9: tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
  10: tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
  11: value[[3L]](cond)</code></pre>

<h3>Internet solutions</h3>
<p>In my meanderings through GitHub issues and StackOverflow, I came across some other solutions to this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/86">this</a> GitHub issue, <a href="https://github.com/lhsego">lhsego</a> writes: “Simply add <code>Sys.setenv(&quot;R_TESTS&quot; = &quot;&quot;)</code> as the first line in tests/testthat.R”<br />
</li>
<li>In the same issue, <a href="https://github.com/espinielli">espinielli</a> writes: “In my particular case, the discrepancy I got between <code>devtools::test()</code> and <code>devtools::check()</code> was due to having the definition of a new unit in a .R file rather than inside <code>.onLoad()</code> (and removing it in <code>.onUnload()</code>).”</li>
<li>On StackOverflow, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42272119/r-cmd-check-fails-devtoolstest-works-fine">wligtenberg</a> ended up self-solving:
“In the end, the issue was trivial. I used <code>base::sort()</code> to create the levels of a factor. (To ensure that they would always align, even if the data was in a different order.) The problem is, that the default sort method depends on the locale of your system. And <code>R CMD check</code> uses a different locale than my interactive session.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to my tweet about this blogpost, <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyElHabr">Tony Elhabr</a> pointed out this passage in the <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html">Tests</a> chapter for the R Packages book that highlights a few other gotchas:</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Debugging this kind of error is no joke! In the future, I would start with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>check the DESCRIPTION file–does it really list <em>all</em> the packages I’m using?</li>
<li>check the <code>Suggests</code> section in other packages–make sure you list any relevant packages in your DESCRIPTION file</li>
<li>clear your environment before running interactive tests and check for the environmental variables listed <a href="#internet-solutions">above</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html#debugging-techniques">be strategic</a>: <em>isolate</em> the problem, test it <em>systematically</em>, and <em>learn</em> from the pain of those who debugged before you.</p>
