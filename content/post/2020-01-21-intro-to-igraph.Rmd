I've worked with `igraph` a few times now, but I usually dive straight into what I want to do and bash my way through. Recently I decided to review the fundamentals...annotating and diagramming to help me remember the terminology and concepts. This post is a collection of those visual notes.

I've worked with `igraph` a few times now, but I usually dive straight into what I want to do and bash my way through. Recently I decided to review the fundamentals as written in the first chapter of this [book draft](https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/pub/books/BookDraft-CsardiNepuszAiroldi2016.pdf) by Csardi, Nepusz, and Airoldi. I haven't been able to track down the final version of the book, so let me know if you know where it is!

Along the way, I took Keynote-notes -- annotating and diagramming to help me remember the terminology and concepts. This post is a collection of those visual notes from chapters 1 & 2.

## Balls and sticks

I think of network graphs as a bunch of balls and sticks, not unlike the magnetic building sticks my baby cousin plays with.

Ignore the bottom right example and you'll find stellar examples of network graphs.  The graphs can come in different shapes and sizes, and even in a rainbow of colors.

In real networks, the silver balls above may also come in varied sizes or colors or shapes. Sometimes the sticks become arrows, or be fat or thin. Using the _official_ terminology, these "balls" are called **vertices** or **nodes**, and the "sticks" are called **edges**. The vertices, edges, or graph as a whole may have additional characteristics, or **attributes**, that describe them, such as size or group. A graph containing edges of different thicknesses, for example, is a **weighted** graph.

If we zoom in on a pair of vertices, we discover a bit more terminology. Edges are defined by the two vertices on each **end** of the edge. In a **directed** edge (with an arrow / has a _direction_), the vertex at the "arrowhead" is the **head** and the "feathered" vertex is the **tail**.

## The igraph class

All the information about a network (e.g. those magnetic structures above) can be stored in an `igraph` object. A graph (g) in the network context is the combination of vertices and edges that make up a network. This does _not_ refer to an actual plot, although you can also easily `plot()` a graph. (Confusing, I know.)

Seeing the output of the `igraph` object for the first time is a bit overwhelming, but this is what it is telling you:

_Note:_ The book makes extensive use of the `igraphdata` package, which includes several example igraph objects, such as the dataset `macaque`, shown above. This makes it easy to explore `igraph` class objects without creating one yourself.

## Vertices and edges

Once you have a graph object chances are, you'll want to look at its parts and maybe modify it. The two basic parts of a graph are the vertices and edges, which you can extract with `V()` and `E()`.

![](/post/2020-01-21-intro-to-igraph_files/igraph-ve.png)

You can specify specific vertices/edges using their position or name:

```{r eval = FALSE}
V(macaque)[1]
V(macaque)["V1"]

E(macaque)[1]
E(macaque)["V1|V2"]
```

To remove or add vertices/edges to a graph, you can use your basic arithmetic operators. Subtracting is easy -- just describe explicitly which vertices or edges you want to remove.

```{r}
macaque - V(macaque)[1:42]
```

To add, you may need the `vertices()` or `edges()` functions. Note that edges can only connect _existing_ vertices.

```{r error = TRUE}
macaque - V(macaque)[1:42] + edges("Id","Id", "Id","35") 
macaque - V(macaque)[1:42] + edges("Id","a vertex that doesn't exist yet") 
```

Like in the examples above, a graph may contain edges that are **self-loops** -- a vertex connected to itself -- or **multigraphs** (a.k.a. duplicated edges). You may sometimes need to **simplify()** a graph to use certain clustering functions (such as `cluster_fast_greedy()`) or do other analyses. This can mean removing loops, removing duplicate edges, or combining the attributes of duplicate edges using a summary functions.

## Graph bits & pieces

Imagine standing on a vertex and starting to walk down an edge, continuing onto connected vertices and edges. The edges that you walk on make up what is called--surprise, surprise--a **path**. Often, network problems involve finding the _shortest path(s)_, or **geodesic**, between two points (think flight connections, for example).

To extract a path from an igraph object, you can specify either the the vertices or edges that make up the path, as seen on the right above.

**Degree** is an attribute of a vertex that describes the number of adjacent edges. The shortest loop that can be made with the edges is the **diameter** of the graph.

When all vertices of a graph are joined to each other via edges, a graph is considered to be **connected**. Directed graphs can be **weakly connected** when vertices are connected in one direction or **strongly connected** when vertices are connected bidirectionally. Graphs where vertices are not all joined are **unconnected**, with **components** that are connected.

Some types of graphs come with special names. **Biconnected** graphs include at least 2 paths between each pair of vertices. A **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) is a graph without ("a-") cyclic paths. That is, no matter what vertex you start on, any path will lead to one of the ending vertices without any repeat vertices. 

![](/post/2020-01-21-intro-to-igraph_files/igraph-biconnected-dag.png)

Sometimes, you may be interested in just a portion of the graph, or **subgraph**. A graph that contains all the vertices _and_ all the edges from the original graph is an **induced subgraph**.

Another way to zoom in on a large graph is via an **ego network**, where you focus on a specific vertex and its closest neighbors.

## That's all folks!
 
There's plenty more detail within the [pdf book](https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/pub/books/BookDraft-CsardiNepuszAiroldi2016.pdf), but the rest will need to wait until another time!
