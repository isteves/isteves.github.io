My background is in conservation and ecology, where I nurtured and developed data and R skills. Through a series of "accidents", I ended up in the Middle East, where I've now found a home among other R enthusiasts in Tel Aviv.

In the last year, I've co-organized and given [data science workshops](https://ecodatasci-tlv.github.io/website/) at the Zoology Department at Tel Aviv University. Our materials are all [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ecodatasci-tlv/) and free for reuse.

I was previously an intern at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), where I worked with [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) to develop a series of coding challenges to cultivate and reward the mastery of R and the tidyverse. Before that, I was a Data Science Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), where I reviewed data submissions to a [national repository](https://arcticdata.io) for completion, clarity, and data management best practices. As a fellow, I also collaborated on a number of open science projects to improve access to Ecological Metadata Language ([EML](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/index.html)) and datasets in the [DataONE network](https://search.dataone.org/index.html#data) (see [metajam](https://github.com/nceas/metajam),  [dataspice](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dataspice)).
