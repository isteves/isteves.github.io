I am currently interning at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), where I'm working with [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) to develop a series of coding challenges to cultivate and reward the mastery of R and the tidyverse. I was previously a Data Science Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), where I reviewed data submissions to a [national repository](https://arcticdata.io) for completion, clarity, and data management best practices. As a fellow, I also collaborated on a number of open science projects to improve access to Ecological Metadata Language ([EML](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/index.html)) and datasets in the [DataONE network](https://search.dataone.org/index.html#data) (see [metajam](https://github.com/nceas/metajam),  [dataspice](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dataspice)).

Before diving into data science, I worked on a number of conservation field projects in California, Nevada, and Florida. When I'm not programming in R, I enjoy reliving my field days by identifying local plants and wildlife. Most recently, I've been obsessed with tidepools and California wildflowers. 

## My future

I plan to move to Tel Aviv in August/September, and I'm looking for a full time position in R programming/data science (remote or Tel-Aviv based) to start in the fall of 2018. My experience includes:

- Package development & collaborative coding with Git/[GitHub](https://github.com/isteves)
- Working with (REST) [API's](https://github.com/nceas/rt)
- Database [queries](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/solr-queries.html)
- Data [exploration and visualization](https://isteves.github.io/watsoncamp/)

If you have any leads for me, or would simply like to chat, my line is open! Contact me through twitter or at irene[AT]rstudio.com.
